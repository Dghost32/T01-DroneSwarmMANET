# Drone Swarm MANET Simulation with ns-3

This project simulates a **drone swarm-based Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)** using the **ns-3** simulator. It sets up a hierarchical wireless network where drones communicate using the **OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) protocol**.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Hierarchical Cluster-Based Network**: Two-level structure with multiple drone clusters.
- **Wi-Fi Communication**: Uses `AarfWifiManager` for rate control.
- **OLSR Routing Protocol**: Optimized routing for dynamic topology.
- **Mobility Model**: Random placement of drones in a 500x500 area.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures **throughput** and **packet loss rate**.
